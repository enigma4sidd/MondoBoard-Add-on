## Summary
Using Location services & Google Maps 2 API, developed the popular feature for cyclists to track each other. 
Used PHP & MySQL for server-side programming. It displays each cyclistâ€™s location on map, estimates time & 
distance to other cyclists, builds a cycling route to a cyclist, and records custom routes of each cyclist on the server.
